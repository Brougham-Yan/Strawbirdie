Gameplay
--------
You are a hungry bird. Press space to fly up, release to fall. Eating strawberries gives points and increases your size a little, while eating popsicles will give you an extra heart and increase your size. Hitting the green monsters will make you lose a heart, while hitting a cloud will cause it to temporarily cover the screen. As you fly you will gradually lose size, if you get too small then it's game over.
